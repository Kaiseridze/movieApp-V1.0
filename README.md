# movieApp-V1.0
Working with asynchronous requests in native JS.  Styling and basic interface.

A simple application that displays top movies.

The API was taken from the site https://kinopoiskapiunofficial.tech/

Which I accessed with the async await function

In this build, primitive pagination and popup work when you click on a movie

Also the search also works (Only the names in it are displayed in Russian)
